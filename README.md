# Enhancing Recommender Systems through User Behaviour Analytics and Context-Aware Suggestions

This repository contains the research materials, implementation guide, and presentation for the paper "Enhancing Recommender Systems through User Behaviour Analytics and Context-Aware Suggestions: A Transformative Paradigm for Digital Commerce and User Experience."

## Overview

This research presents a comprehensive analysis of how advanced user behaviour analytics and context-aware computing can revolutionize recommender system effectiveness. The work argues that traditional collaborative filtering and content-based approaches are fundamentally inadequate for addressing the dynamic, multi-dimensional nature of contemporary user needs and market demands.

The study employs a mixed-methods approach, combining a systematic literature review, empirical analysis of the Amazon Reviews 2023 dataset, and the development of the Intelligent Context-Aware Behaviour Analytics Recommender (ICABAR) framework.
