 # ICABAR Framework: Integration and Performance Test Scenarios

This document details the scenarios for integration testing, performance benchmarking, and research validation for the ICABAR Framework.

## 1. Integration Test Scenarios

**Objective**: To test the end-to-end functionality of the `ICABARFramework`, ensuring that all modules work together correctly.

### Scenario 1: Full Pipeline Execution

- **Description**: This test simulates a complete user journey, from training the framework on a dataset to generating recommendations for multiple users.
- **Setup**:
    - A synthetic dataset of 1000 interactions, 50 users, and 100 items.
    - The dataset will include users with varied interaction patterns (e.g., some with many reviews, some with few).
- **Actions**:
    1. Initialize `ICABARFramework` with the default configuration.
    2. Call the `train()` method with the synthetic dataset.
    3. Call the `predict()` method for a user known to be in the dataset.
    4. Call the `predict()` method for a new user (cold start).
- **Expected Outcomes**:
    - The `train()` method completes without errors.
    - The `predict()` call for the existing user returns a list of 10 unique item IDs.
    - The `predict()` call for the new user returns a list of 10 globally popular items.
    - All returned recommendations are valid item IDs present in the original dataset.

### Scenario 2: Invalid Configuration

- **Description**: This test ensures the framework handles invalid configuration gracefully.
- **Actions**:
    1. Initialize `ICABARFramework` with a configuration where `ensemble_weights` do not sum to 1.0.
- **Expected Outcomes**:
    - A `ValueError` is raised during initialization by the `validate_config` function.

### Scenario 3: Empty or Invalid Data

- **Description**: This test verifies the framework's robustness when provided with empty or malformed data.
- **Actions**:
    1. Initialize the framework.
    2. Call the `train()` method with an empty DataFrame.
    3. Call the `train()` method with a DataFrame missing a required column (e.g., `rating`).
- **Expected Outcomes**:
    - A `ValueError` is raised in both cases, with a clear error message indicating the problem.

## 2. Performance Benchmarks

**Objective**: To validate that the framework's prediction latency meets the 47ms average response time documented in the research.

- **Methodology**:
    1. **Dataset**: Use a large-scale dataset (e.g., a 100,000-interaction subset of the Amazon Reviews dataset).
    2. **Training**: Train the `ICABARFramework` on this dataset.
    3. **Benchmarking**: Use the `timeit` module to measure the execution time of the `predict()` method. This will be done for a sample of 1,000 random users from the dataset.
    4. **Calculation**: Calculate the average, median, 95th percentile, and 99th percentile prediction times.
- **Success Criterion**: The average prediction time across all runs should be less than or equal to 47ms.

## 3. Research Validation Procedures

**Objective**: To empirically validate the performance claims (accuracy, diversity, novelty) made in the research paper.

- **Baseline Model**: A standard user-based collaborative filtering (CF) model will be implemented as the baseline for comparison.
- **Dataset**: The full Amazon Reviews 2023 dataset will be used, split into a training and a test set (e.g., 80/20 split).
- **Metrics**:
    - **Accuracy**: Precision@10 and Recall@10.
    - **Diversity**: Intra-list diversity, calculated as the average pairwise dissimilarity between items in a recommendation list.
    - **Novelty**: The proportion of recommended items that are not in the top-N most popular items in the training set.
- **Procedure**:
    1. Train both the ICABAR Framework and the baseline CF model on the training set.
    2. For each user in the test set, generate the top 10 recommendations from both models.
    3. Calculate the accuracy, diversity, and novelty for the recommendations generated by each model.
    4. Compare the average scores for each metric between the ICABAR Framework and the baseline model.
- **Success Criteria**:
    - **Accuracy**: ICABAR shows a ~33% relative improvement over the baseline.
    - **Diversity**: ICABAR shows a ~65% relative improvement over the baseline.
    - **Novelty**: ICABAR shows a ~45% relative improvement over the baseline.
