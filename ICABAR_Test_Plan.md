# ICABAR Framework Test Plan

**Document Version:** 1.0

**Date:** 2025-10-06

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose

This document provides a comprehensive test plan for the Intelligent Context-Aware Behaviour Analytics Recommender (ICABAR) Framework. It outlines the scope, approach, resources, and schedule of all testing activities. The purpose of this plan is to ensure that the framework meets the quality standards required for both academic validation and production deployment, and that it verifiably delivers the performance improvements documented in the associated research.

This plan follows the IEEE 829 Standard for Software and System Test Documentation.

### 1.2 Scope

The scope of this test plan encompasses the complete ICABAR Framework Python package, including all its modules, functions, and associated documentation. The testing will cover functional correctness, reliability, performance, and the empirical validation of research claims.

### 1.3 Testing Objectives

The primary objectives of the testing effort are as follows:

- **Functional Correctness**: To verify that all components of the ICABAR Framework function as specified in the implementation guide. This includes data processing, feature extraction, model training, and prediction generation.

- **Research Claim Validation**: To empirically validate the performance improvements claimed in the research thesis. This involves rigorously testing the following key metrics against a baseline model:
    - **Accuracy**: Achieve a ~33% relative improvement.
    - **Diversity**: Achieve a ~65% relative improvement.
    - **Novelty**: Achieve a ~45% relative improvement.

- **Performance and Scalability**: To ensure the framework meets the non-functional requirements for production deployment, specifically the **47ms average prediction response time**, and to assess its performance under increasing load.

- **Production Readiness**: To guarantee the framework is robust, reliable, and maintainable. This includes ensuring comprehensive error handling, clear documentation, and high test coverage.

- **Code Quality**: To enforce high coding standards and maintain a test coverage of at least 90% to facilitate future development and maintenance.



## 2. Test Items

This section identifies the items to be tested.

### 2.1 In-Scope Items

The following components of the ICABAR Framework are in scope for testing:

- **Core Framework (`icabar/main.py`):** The main orchestrator class, including its initialization, training, and prediction methods.
- **User Behaviour Analytics Module (`icabar/features/user_behaviour.py`):** All methods related to data processing, feature engineering, user segmentation, and behavioral prediction.
- **Context-Aware Suggestion Engine (`icabar/features/context_aware.py`):** All methods for processing contextual information and adapting recommendations.
- **Integration Module (`icabar/models/integration.py`):** The logic for combining recommendations using weighted ensembles, confidence scoring, and diversity promotion.
- **Utilities (`icabar/utils/`):** All helper functions and configuration management utilities.
- **Installation and Dependencies (`setup.py`, `requirements.txt`):** The package installation process and the integrity of its dependencies.

### 2.2 Out-of-Scope Items

The following items are considered out of scope for this test plan:

- **Third-Party Libraries:** The internal workings of third-party libraries (e.g., `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow`) will not be tested. We will only test their integration with the framework.
- **Hardware and Operating System:** The underlying hardware and operating system are not part of the testing scope, although the test environment will be documented.
- **The Amazon Reviews 2023 Dataset:** The dataset itself will not be validated for correctness; it will only be used as an input for testing.

## 3. Testing Approach

Our testing approach is a multi-layered strategy designed to ensure comprehensive validation of the ICABAR Framework. This approach combines white-box and black-box testing techniques across four distinct levels.

### 3.1 Unit Testing

- **Objective:** To verify the functionality of individual components in isolation.
- **Technique:** White-box testing.
- **Methodology:** Each class and method will be tested with a dedicated set of unit tests using the `unittest` framework. Mock data and stubs will be used to isolate components.

### 3.2 Integration Testing

- **Objective:** To verify the interaction and data flow between the integrated modules.
- **Technique:** Black-box testing.
- **Methodology:** The tests will focus on the `ICABARFramework` class as a whole, testing the complete pipeline from data input to recommendation output. Scenarios will include valid data, invalid data, and edge cases.

### 3.3 Performance Testing

- **Objective:** To benchmark the framework's performance and scalability.
- **Technique:** Black-box testing.
- **Methodology:** The prediction latency will be measured under simulated production load using large-scale datasets. Tools like `cProfile` and `timeit` will be used for profiling.

### 3.4 Research Validation Testing

- **Objective:** To empirically validate the research claims.
- **Technique:** Black-box testing.
- **Methodology:** The framework's performance (accuracy, diversity, novelty) will be compared against a baseline collaborative filtering model using the full research dataset. Statistical significance of the results will be assessed.



## 4. Test Cases

Detailed test cases are specified in the following documents:

- **Unit Test Specifications:** `UNIT_TEST_SPECIFICATIONS.md`
- **Integration and Performance Test Scenarios:** `INTEGRATION_AND_PERFORMANCE_TESTS.md`

These documents provide a comprehensive set of test cases covering all testing levels, from individual component verification to end-to-end pipeline validation and research claim verification.
