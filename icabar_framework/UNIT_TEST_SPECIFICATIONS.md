 # ICABAR Framework: Unit Test Specifications

This document provides detailed specifications for the unit tests of each core module in the ICABAR Framework.

## 1. UserBehaviourAnalytics Module (`tests/test_user_behaviour.py`)

**Objective**: To verify the correctness of the data processing, feature engineering, and prediction logic within the `UserBehaviourAnalytics` class.

| **Method** | **Test Case** | **Description** | **Expected Outcome** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `__init__` | TestInitialization | Verifies that the module initializes correctly with the provided data and configuration. | The `data` and `config` attributes are correctly set. |
| `preprocess_data` | TestPreprocessingWithValidData | Runs the preprocessing pipeline on a valid, well-formed DataFrame. | All expected columns (e.g., `hour`, `season`, `engagement_score`) are created and have the correct data types. |
| | TestPreprocessingWithMissingValues | Processes a DataFrame containing `NaN` values in `review_text`. | `review_length` is filled with 0, and the process completes without errors. |
| `calculate_engagement_scores` | TestEngagementScoreRange | Calculates engagement scores on a varied dataset. | All calculated scores are between 0 and 1, inclusive. |
| `segment_users` | TestUserSegmentation | Segments a dataset with a sufficient number of users. | The `user_segments` dictionary is populated with the correct number of users and segments. |
| | TestSegmentationWithFewUsers | Attempts to segment a dataset with fewer users than the number of clusters. | The number of clusters is automatically adjusted, and the process completes without errors. |
| `predict` | TestPredictionForExistingUser | Generates recommendations for a user present in the training data. | A list of item IDs is returned, ordered by the user's preference. |
| | TestPredictionForNewUser | Generates recommendations for a user not present in the training data. | A list of globally popular items is returned as a fallback. |

## 2. ContextAwareSuggestionEngine Module (`tests/test_context_aware.py`)

**Objective**: To ensure the `ContextAwareSuggestionEngine` correctly processes contextual information and adapts its recommendations accordingly.

| **Method** | **Test Case** | **Description** | **Expected Outcome** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `train` | TestTrainingProcess | Verifies that the training process runs to completion. | The `trained` flag is set to `True`. |
| `extract_contextual_features` | TestFeatureExtraction | Checks if contextual features are extracted from the data. | The `contextual_features` dictionary is populated. |
| `predict` | TestPredictionWithContext | Generates recommendations for the same user at different times of the day. | The recommendations returned for different hours should differ, reflecting the temporal context. |

## 3. IntegrationModule (`tests/test_integration.py`)

**Objective**: To validate the logic of the `IntegrationModule`, ensuring it correctly combines, ranks, and diversifies the recommendations from the other modules.

| **Method** | **Test Case** | **Description** | **Expected Outcome** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `integrate` | TestWeightedEnsemble | Integrates two lists of recommendations with known scores. | The final list is correctly ranked based on the weighted scores. Items present in both lists should have higher scores. |
| | TestIntegrationWithEmptyInputs | Attempts to integrate empty lists of recommendations. | An empty list is returned without errors. |
| | TestDiversityAndNovelty | Integrates predictions and checks if diversity/novelty logic is applied. | The final ranking is adjusted based on the diversity and novelty factors. (This will be a simplified check for the boilerplate). |

## 4. Utilities (`tests/test_utils.py`)

**Objective**: To ensure the helper and configuration functions in the `utils` package are working correctly.

| **Function** | **Test Case** | **Description** | **Expected Outcome** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `validate_config` | TestValidConfiguration | Passes a valid, default configuration to the validator. | The function completes without raising any exceptions. |
| | TestInvalidConfigMissingKeys | Passes a configuration dictionary with missing top-level keys. | A `ValueError` is raised. |
| | TestInvalidEnsembleWeightsSum | Passes a configuration where the ensemble weights do not sum to 1.0. | A `ValueError` is raised. |
| `get_season` | TestAllSeasons | Calls the function for each month of the year. | The correct season ('Winter', 'Spring', 'Summer', 'Autumn') is returned for each month. |
