'''
Context-Aware Computing Module for the ICABAR Framework.

This module is responsible for incorporating multi-dimensional contextual information to
adapt recommendations to the user's current situation. It implements several key
functionalities as described in the research, including:

- Processing of temporal, spatial, social, and activity contexts.
- Dynamic adaptation of recommendations based on the current context.
- Contextual feature extraction to enrich user and item data.
- Similarity measures to find relevant items for a given context.
