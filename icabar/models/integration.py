'''
Integration Module for the ICABAR Framework.

This module is responsible for combining the outputs from the User Behaviour Analytics
and Context-Aware Computing modules to produce a final, unified recommendation list.
It implements several key functionalities as described in the research, including:

- Weighted ensemble methods to combine recommendation scores.
- Confidence scoring to assess the reliability of recommendations.
- Diversity and novelty promotion to enhance user discovery.
